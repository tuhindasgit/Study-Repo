A: Step 1: Create a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 with tenancy as Default
Step 2: Add Subnets to this VPC
 
Step 3: Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the  VPC
Step 4: Create a Route Table containing Internet Gateway within its route
Step 5: Associate this Route table to the subnet to make it “Public”
 
Step 6: Launch instances in each of the subnets
Step 7: Assign Elastic IPs to instances in Public Subnet
 
Step 8: Connect to instances via SSH/RDP
 
Step 9:  Create a NAT Security Group
 
Step 10: Launch a NAT Instance with security group in Step 9. Attach new Elastic IP
Step 11: Disable Source/Destination Check for NAT instance
Step 12: Associate NAT instance to private subnet
Step 13: Associate route table to the private subnet
Step 14: Test the setup
