Hello Everyone,
 
Tip for getting Extra 30 mins for the people who donâ€™t know about this accommodation in AWS Exam.
 
Log into your CertMetrics account(https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/)
Go to the "Upcoming Exams" screen.
Press the button marked "Request Exam Accommodations".
In the "Request Accommodation" form, enter "ESL +30 minutes" for the "Accommodation type".
Before you book your exam, wait for AWS to respond, and provide them with any documentation/information they might request of you.
Once AWS responds, we can see the below screen(Status Approved).
 

 
Finally we get extra time for getting the exam.
Note: This should be done before scheduling the exam.
 
Now while scheduling you will see the below Screen(i.e. 110 Minutes).

 
All the best !!!!!
